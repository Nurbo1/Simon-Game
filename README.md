# Simon-Game
 !! It is simple Simon Game, which is implemented by me.   https://nurbo1.github.io/Simon-Game/
 
 !!Press any Key to Start and Play.
 
 !!Here is the rule: 

Press the START button. Simon will give the first signal. Repeat the signal by pressing the same color lens.

Simon will duplicate the first signal and add one. Repeat these two signals by pressing the same color lenses, in order.

Simon will duplicate these first two signals and add one.

Continue playing as long as you can repeat each sequence of sig- nals correctly. 

If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, Simon responds with a "RAZZ" sound. This means you've lost, and the sequence of signals ends.
